[DES-3] Description of Design for checkpoint1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a content delievery system for video. By checkpoint 1, we have 
implemented the following functionalities:
1 Proxy is able to take client's request and parse it.
2 Proxy is able to forward request from client to server.
3 Proxy is able to take response from server and forward back to client
4 Proxy can requset and get two specific files(*_nolist.f4m and *.f4m) and send *_nolist.f4m
back to client. This file doesn't contain bitrate options.
5 Proxy is able to compute current chosen bitrate based on current average throughput.
6 Proxy is able to adjust requests to different bitrate according to current throughput.
7 Proxy is able to support concurrency. It can support multiple clients
8 Proxy is able to generate a lof file which contains information about time duration, bitrate etc.


[DES-4] Description of Design for checkpoint2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 All functionalities achieved in checkpoint-1
2 Proxy is able to resolve the address(domain name) which clients request
3 Nameserver is able to take dns query and send back correct response ip address
4 Nameserver is able to do load balancing. Two adopted algorithms are Round robin and OSPF.
5 Nameserver is able to generate a log file which contains all dns reslove records.
