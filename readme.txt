[DES-3] Description of Design for checkpoint1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a peer to peer download application. By checkpoint 1, we have 
implemented the following functionalities:
1 Peer initialized with the knowledge of self information including identity, hasChunks, 
  and other reachable peers.
2 Peer is able to receive GET command from the command line.
3 Peer is able to parse the GET command and send WHOHAS packet to all reachable peers to
  discover available peers which has the desired file.
4 Peer is able to generate IHAVE response to received WHOHAS packet and send back. Peer
  does not send back IHAVE response if it does not have any requested file

[DES-4] Description of Design for checkpoint2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 When a peer receive IHAVE response, it is able to generate corresponding GET requests
  and send then one after one.
2 When a peer receive GET request, it is able to generate corresponding DATA packets and
  send them under the constraint of congestion control.
3 A sending peer is able to maintain a congestion window, which has an initial value of 8
  and a ssthresh of 64. The window size is changing at the time of receiving ACK
  packet and the changing value depends on the current state of sending peer, which is either
  slow start or congestion avoidance.
4 When a peer receive a DATA packet, it is able to, according to the sequence number of DATA
  packet, generate corresponding ACK packet and decide whether to store the data or drop it.
5 A peer is able to maintain a upload pool and a download pool with given number of connections.
6 when thereâ€™s a timeout occurred(10 seconds no response), the downloading peer is able to find 
  other available peers to re-start download.
